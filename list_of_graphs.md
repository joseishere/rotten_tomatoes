## Graphs I think would like:


1. Genre vs rating - to see which genre is the most highly rated
2. rating vs length - to see if longer is better
	- also need to make sure that nothing that isn't a film, aka less than 60 minute runtime is not included.
3. rating vs director - which is the best director
4. rating vs actor - which is the best actor/actress
5. rating vs production company - which production company makes the best movies
6. budget vs rating - does more money = better
7. to go along with number 6, what rating will you get per dollar spent
	- spent 100 got a 9 rating
	- rating/dollars
	- .09 rating per dollar. could be interesting
- 8. release date v rating - are older movies better than new movies
